## Overview

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It allows you to separate you to separate applications from your machine and run them in a container. This is useful for many reasons, such as portability,
isolation, and resource management. Docker is a very powerful tool and is used in many different applications.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

There are many different ways to install Docker, depending on your operating system. The official Docker documentation has a great guide on how to install Docker on your system. You can find the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).

What do we recommend? We recommend you to install Docker Engine instead of Docker Desktop (even for WSL2 to prevent any issues).

<Callout type="info">
    We will be assuming Linux (Ubuntu) for the rest of the guide. Guide for
    other OSes is not much different.
</Callout>

### Linux (Ubuntu)

<Callout type="info">
    The following commands are for Ubuntu. For other distributions, please refer
    to the official documentation.
</Callout>

Official [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) will be followed. It is recommended to follow the official guide for the most up-to-date instructions.

<Callout type="warn">
    Make sure to follow this [post installation
    step](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
    to manage Docker as a non-root user if following the official guide.
</Callout>

```bash title="Remove old versions"
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```

```bash title="Setup Docker's apt repository"
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

<Callout type="info">
    If you use an Ubuntu derivative distro, such as Linux Mint, you may need to
    use `UBUNTU_CODENAME` instead of `VERSION_CODENAME`.
</Callout>

```bash title="Install Docker Engine"
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

```bash title="Post-installation steps for Linux"
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

```bash title="Verify installation"
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```
