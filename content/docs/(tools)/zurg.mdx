   ```

   After pulling the image, you can run it using Docker Compose or a Docker run command, as described in the "Running Zurg with Docker" section below.


## Configuration

For v0.10, Zurg's configuration is primarily done through the `config.yml` file. Refer to the [Zurg GitHub repository](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/zurg-testing/wiki/Config-v0.10) for detailed configuration options.

<details>
<summary>Basic Configuration</summary>

```yaml
zurg: v1
token: YOUR_RD_API_TOKEN

enable_repair: true
rar_action: extract
addl_playable_extensions:
  - mp3
  - flac

cache_network_test_results: true

on_library_update: |
  for arg in "$@"
  do
      echo "detected update on: $arg"
  done

auto_analyze_new_torrents: true
```

- `zurg`: Configuration version (currently v1)
- `token`: Your Real-Debrid API token
- `enable_repair`: Enable automatic torrent repair
- `rar_action`: Action for RAR files (extract, delete, or none)
- `addl_playable_extensions`: Additional file extensions to consider playable
- `cache_network_test_results`: Cache network test results
- `on_library_update`: Script to run when the library is updated
- `auto_analyze_new_torrents`: Analyze new torrents for media info

</details>

<details>
<summary>Directory Definitions and Filters</summary>

```yaml
directories:
  anime:
    group: media
    group_order: 10
    filters:
      - and:
        - has_episodes: true
        - any_file_inside_regex: /^\[/
        - any_file_inside_not_regex: /s\d\de\d\d/i

  shows:
    group: media
    group_order: 20
    filters:
      - has_episodes: true

  movies:
    group: media
    group_order: 30
    only_show_the_biggest_file: true
    filters:
      - regex: /.*/

  "4k english shows":
    filters:
      - and:
        - media_info_with_audio_language: eng
        - media_info_resolution: 4k
        - has_episodes: true

  # ... more directory definitions ...
```

Each directory can have:
- `group`: Categorizes directories
- `group_order`: Prioritizes directories within the same group
- `filters`: Conditions to determine which torrents belong in this directory
- `only_show_the_biggest_file`: Show only the largest file in the torrent

</details>

<details>
<summary>Filter Types</summary>

- `regex`, `contains`, `contains_strict`: Filter by torrent name
- `not_regex`, `not_contains`, `not_contains_strict`: Exclude torrents
- `size_gte`, `size_lte`: Filter by torrent size
- `any_file_inside_*`: Apply filtering to file names within the torrent
- `has_episodes`: Detect torrents containing episode sequences
- `is_music`: Detect music torrents
- `media_info_*`: Filter by media information (resolution, bit rate, duration, languages)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Advanced Filtering</summary>

Use nested `and` and `or` to create complex filter logic:

```yaml
filters:
  - and:
      - contains: keyword1
      - not_contains: keyword2
  - or:
      - contains_strict: Keyword3
      - any_file_inside_regex: /pattern/i
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Configuration</summary>

Here's a more detailed sample configuration:

```yaml
# Zurg configuration version
zurg: v1
token: YOUR_RD_API_TOKEN # https://real-debrid.com/apitoken

# Each token in RD allows some amount of bandwidth daily
# If you need to go over past this limit (e.g. Plex extensive analysis)
# you can buy a new RD account and specify the token here
# download_tokens:
# - ANOTHER_RD_API_TOKEN
# - ANOTHER_RD_API_TOKEN_2

# Do not change this if you are running it inside a docker container
# host: "[::]"
# port: 9999

# You can protect your zurg server with username+password auth
# username: yowmamasita
# password: 1234

# You can proxy all zurg requests like this:
# proxy: "http://[username:password@]host:port"
# proxy: "https://[username:password@]host:port"
# proxy: "socks5://[username:password@]host:port"

# BEWARE! THERE CAN ONLY BE 1 INSTANCE OF ZURG THAT SHOULD REPAIR YOUR TORRENTS
enable_repair: true
# Action to take when encountering RAR files (extract, delete, or none)
rar_action: extract
# Add file extensions that you want to be considered playable and extracted from rar's (not moved to the unplayable directory)
addl_playable_extensions:
- mp3
- flac

# How often should zurg look for broken torrents and repair them?
# repair_every_mins: 60

# How often should zurg remount all your downloads?
# downloads_every_mins: 720

# How often should zurg dump your zurgtorrent files to the dump folder?
# dump_torrents_every_mins: 1440

# RD API timeout setting
# api_timeout_secs: 60

# RD download timeout setting
# download_timeout_secs: 10

# API response failures until considered failed
# retries_until_failed: 2

# Every time zurg runs, it will do tests checking RD download servers reachability
# this setting saves the results in a file so it doesn't run every startup
cache_network_test_results: true

# This is useful for ensuring Plex adds your new content immediately
# Uncomment the next line for triggering a partial scan
# on_library_update: sh plex_update.sh "$@"
# on_library_update: '& C:\zurg\plex_udpdate.ps1 $args'
on_library_update: |
  for arg in "$@"
  do
      echo "detected update on: $arg"
  done

# In order to use media_info_* filters, your torrents need to be analyzed first
auto_analyze_new_torrents: true

# List of directory definitions and their filtering rules
directories:
  # Configuration for anime shows
  anime:
    group: media # directories on different groups have duplicates of the same torrent
    group_order: 10 # group order = priority, it defines who eats first on a group
    filters:
      - and: # you can use nested 'and' & 'or' conditions
        - has_episodes: true # intelligent detection of episode files inside a torrent
        - any_file_inside_regex: /^\[/ # usually anime starts with [ e.g. [SubsPlease]
        - any_file_inside_not_regex: /s\d\de\d\d/i # and usually anime doesn't use SxxExx

  shows:
    group: media
    group_order: 20
    filters:
      - has_episodes: true  # intelligent detection of episode files inside a torrent

  movies:
    group: media  # because anime, shows and movies are in the same group,
    group_order: 30 # and anime and shows has a lower group_order number than movies, all torrents that doesn't fall into the previous 2 will fall into movies
    only_show_the_biggest_file: true # let's not show the other files besides the movie itself
    filters:
      - regex: /.*/ # you cannot leave a directory without filters because it will not have any torrents in it

  # media info directories

  # when you use media_info filters group_order doesn't matter anymore
  # just make sure they are on unique groups
  # in future versions (0.10rc3+), you can opt to omit group completely

  "4k english shows":
    filters:
      - and:
        - media_info_with_audio_language: eng
        - media_info_resolution: 4k
