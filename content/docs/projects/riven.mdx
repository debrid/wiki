3. Organizing your media library using a smart symlink system.
4. Seamlessly integrating with your chosen media server for immediate streaming access.
5. Providing a user-friendly web interface for easy management and configuration.

Whether you're a casual viewer or a media enthusiast, Riven offers a powerful, automated solution to keep your media library up-to-date and easily accessible.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Riven, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

</Cards>

<Callout type="info">
    Currently only Real-Debrid, All-Debrid and Torbox are supported. More
    services will be added in the future.
</Callout>

## Setup

Before we begin, we need to set up the required folders and files for Riven.

### Clone repository and create folders

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rivenmedia/riven
cd riven
mkdir data
```

`riven` folder consists of `data` folder and `docker-compose.yml` file which will be used later.

### Setup Library folder

#### What is Library folder?

Library folder is the folder where Riven will store movie/show files and [symlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link).
These point to the actual files on the rclone mount

For this example, we are assuming `/mnt/zurg` is the rclone mount path.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/library
```

## Installation

`docker-compose.yml` file is used to run Riven in a containerized environment. It consists of three services:

1. `riven`: The main Riven application.
2. `riven-frontend`: The web interface for Riven.
3. `riven-db`: The database for Riven.

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
    riven-frontend:
        image: spoked/riven-frontend:latest
        container_name: riven-frontend
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        tty: true
        environment:
            - PUID=1000
            - PGID=1000
            - TZ=America/New_York
            - ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
            - BACKEND_URL=http://riven:8080
            - DIALECT=postgres
            - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@riven-db/riven
        depends_on:
            riven:
                condition: service_healthy

    riven:
        image: spoked/riven:latest
        container_name: riven
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
        tty: true
        environment:
            - PUID=1000
            - PGID=1000
            - TZ=America/New_York
            - RIVEN_FORCE_ENV=true
            - RIVEN_DATABASE_HOST=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@riven-db/riven
        healthcheck:
            test: curl -s http://localhost:8080 >/dev/null || exit 1
            interval: 30s
            timeout: 10s
            retries: 10
        volumes:
            - ./data:/riven/data
            - /mnt:/mnt
        depends_on:
            riven_postgres:
                condition: service_healthy

    riven_postgres:
        image: postgres:16.3-alpine3.20
        container_name: riven-db
        environment:
            PGDATA: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
            POSTGRES_USER: postgres
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
            POSTGRES_DB: riven
        volumes:
            - ./riven-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
            interval: 10s
            timeout: 5s
            retries: 5
```

Now this won't work as is, you need to modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to match your setup.

1. Change `TZ` to your timezone.
2. Change `ORIGIN` to the URL you will be accessing the web interface from. For example, if you are planning to run Riven on `https://riven.example.com`,
   change it to `https://riven.example.com`. This is not required if you are running riven behind a reverse proxy like `nginx`, `caddy`, `cosmos` etc.
3. Change `BACKEND_URL` to the URL where the frontend can access the backend. This is not required here as we are running both frontend and backend in the same network (stack).
4. Change `RIVEN_DATABASE_HOST` to the URL where the backend can access the database. This is not required here as we are running both backend and database in the same network (stack).
5. Change `DIALECT` and `DATABASE_URL` to use the same database as the backend. This is not required here as we are running both backend and database in the same network (stack).
6. Change `volumes` to match your setup. Riven requires access to the library folder and rclone mount path.

## Running Riven

To run Riven, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the Riven services in the background. You can access the Riven web interface by navigating to the specified `ORIGIN` URL or reverse proxy URL.

## Configuration

Once Riven is running, you can configure it by accessing the web interface. You will be prompted with onboarding steps to set up your debrid service, media server, content services and scraper services.

There are 4 steps in the onboarding process:

### General Settings

In this step you configure the downloaders (debrid services), rclone mount path, library path, subtitles, etc. See the image below for an example.

Once you have completed the onboarding process, you will be greeted with a beautiful dashboard where you can manage your media library, request items, settings and many more in the future.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Save changes is doing nothing in onboarding/settings">
        The most common reason for this is that you may have not setup `ORIGIN`
        correctly in the `docker-compose.yml` file. If you are running Riven
        behind a reverse proxy, you can remove the `ORIGIN` environment variable
        from the `riven-frontend` service.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I am seeing error when trying to save changes">
        If you are seeing an error when trying to save changes, it is most likely
        due to incorrect configuration or backend failure. Please check the logs of the `riven` service
        to see the error message. If you are unable to resolve the issue, feel free
        to ask for help in the [Riven Discord server](https://discord.gg/wDgVdH8vNM).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I am stuck in onboarding loop">
        If you are stuck in the onboarding loop, it is most likely due to `symlink` settings being wrong.
        Check your `library` path and `rclone` mount path. If they are correct, check the logs of the `riven` service.
        If you are unable to resolve the issue, feel free to ask for help in the [Riven Discord server](https://discord.gg/wDgVdH8vNM).
